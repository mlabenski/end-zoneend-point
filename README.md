# The Web Hook: Getting Started

This Flask server has a public URL to intercept web traffic. The original event pokes this web server for another action.

# Actions 
1) To store data from an API interaction in an external DB
2) Complete the interaction sequence as a information providing API may not support webhooks
3) More access to the events and systems taking place by tapping into the REST sequence.
